# Spotify_Playlist_Create
Overview: This project was designed to automatically create a new Spotify playlist and add songs from HotNewHipHop's top 100 by scanning the website for new songs from artists I enjoy. 

Aside from small scripts I wrote while at school, this was my first coding project.  This small project gave me an understaing of how I could automate a simple part of my life.  Before this project, I understood the base concepts of programming, but never really knew how to apply them to real life scenarios. 

What I learned:
API - This was my first time working with an API.  I never really understood what they were beforehand.
Version Control - I knew version control was a key part of any project, so I figured this would be a perfect project to learn the basics of GitHub with.
