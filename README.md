# Spotify_Playlist_Create
Overview: This project was designed to automatically create a new Spotify playlist and add songs from HotNewHipHop's top 100 by scanning the 
website for new songs from artists I enjoy.  The script searches for and adds new songs for me every morning at 7AM using Automator.  A new 
playlist is also created for me on the first of every month in order to keep things fresh.
