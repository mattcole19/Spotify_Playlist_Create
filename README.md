# Spotify_Playlist_Create
## Overview 
This project was designed to automatically create a new Spotify playlist and add songs from HotNewHipHop's top 100 by scanning the website for new songs from artists I enjoy. 

## Disclaimer
Aside from small scripts I wrote while at school, this was my one of my first coding projects.  Before this project, I understood the base concepts of programming, but never really knew how to apply them to real life scenarios. This script made me realize the endless power of programming.  

## What I learned
- API - This was my first time working with an API.  I never really understood what they were beforehand. Lucky for me, Spotify had a well-documented API that fit in perfectly with my objective.
- Version Control - I knew version control was a key part of any project, so I figured this would be a perfect project to learn the basics of GitHub.
- Web Scraping - I had previously worked a little bit with Beautiful Soup and Requests, but this project helped me learn more about how Python can scrape the web for information.
- Functional Programming - In my previous projects, I had only ever used a few functions in a script.  This taught me how to separate one big problem into separate objectives.
